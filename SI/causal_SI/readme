Tigramite_Tests: Contains information theoretic test of independence, taken from the tigramite library (https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite). It is needed when selecting mutual information as the independence test in the PC algorithm.

castle: Contains the gcastle library (https://github.com/huawei-noah/trustworthyAI/tree/master/gcastle), with the slight modification of the following files:
1-castle/common/independence_test.py: We added more independence tests, including the Spearman correlation
2-castle/algorithms/pc/pc.py: We added the names of the new independence tests so that they can be called in the PC initialization 

msa_cd.py: 

- Load data center counts data for the MSAs
- Load the regressor variables for the MSAs
- Merge the two datasets
- Initialize and run the PC algorithm
- Compute pairwise correlations
- Display the causality graph with links colored based on the sign of the correlation


Input:
datasets with columns representing variables, and rows representing realizations

output:
Causal graph

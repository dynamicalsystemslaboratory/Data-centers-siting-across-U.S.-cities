WORKFLOW 
1) Estimate state-level emissions allocated to data centers 
2) Classify data centers by Energy Community (EC) category 
3) Test whether future vs operational sites differ spatially

dc_emission_all.py

- Load data center shapefile, eGRID data, FIPS table, and state polygons 
- Keep contiguous U.S. only 
- Compute state emissions factor: tons CO2 / MW of nameplate capacity 
- Aggregate data centers by state: 
- count mean / median / min / max capacity 
- Estimate emissions by multiplying capacity stats by emissions factor 
- Merge results with state geometries 

INPUTS 
- Data center shapefile with power_mw field 
- eGRID emissions spreadsheet 
- State FIPS table 
- US states shapefile

OUTPUTS 
- Emission estimates by state 
- Scatter plot capacity vs emissions factor 
- Choropleth emission maps


EC_analysis.py


 - Load states, MSAs, data centers, and EC layers 
 - Keep contiguous U.S. and project to EPSG:5070 
 - Keep data centers located inside cities 
 - Build mutually exclusive EC spatial areas
 - Label data centers: 
    - Current = Operational 
    - Future = Planned / Under Construction / Land Banked 
 - Build contingency table (2 × 4) 
 - Run Chi-square test of independence

OUTPUTS 
- EC classification of data centers 
- Contingency table 
- Chi-square statistical test results

INPUTS 
- State shapefile 
- CBSA shapefile 
- Data center shapefile 
- IRA Energy Community layers (Coal + Energy Revenue) 
- State FIPS table

SUMMARY These scripts quantify data-center emissions and test whether
future development is disproportionately located in Energy Communities.
